# Evaluating Equations

This Python script contains read, write, and append file Handling and graphing using Matplotlib.
It evaluates a set of equations for specified values of x and plots the results. 

**Input Equations**: Ten quations (E1-E10) is written in a file named `equations.txt`, with each equation a separate line in the format `E1 = expression`,
                      where `E1` is the equation label and `expression` is the mathematical expression involving `x`

**Input Values of x**: When prompted, User can enter the values of x (1 to 50) separated by commas. It will be the value of the x that will be substituted to every  variable x in the equations from `equations.txt`.

**View Results**: The script will evaluate the equations for each value of x, plot the results using Matplotlib, and save the results to a file named `results.txt`.

**Remove Numbers**: Optionally, you can choose to remove specific numbers from the plotted results, and save the new results to a file named `results.txt`.

**Continue or Exit**: After viewing the results, you can choose to continue with different numbers or exit the script.
